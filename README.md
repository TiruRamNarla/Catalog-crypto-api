# Catalog Crypto API

The **Catalog Crypto API** is a comprehensive RESTful API designed for managing and querying cryptocurrency-related historical data. This API provides endpoints for various cryptocurrency histories such as depth, earnings, swap, and runepool units. It is built with Rust and provides efficient access to the required data through various routes and migration scripts.

---

## Project Overview

This API allows users to interact with cryptocurrency-related data, such as:
- Depth history
- Earnings history
- Swap history
- Runepool units history

The project includes models, migrations, routes, and cron jobs that automate fetching and storing the data at regular intervals.

## Installation

To run the Catalog Crypto API locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Catalog-crypto-api.git
   cd Catalog-crypto-api
Install Rust:

If you havenâ€™t already installed Rust, you can do so by following the installation instructions on the Rust official website.

bash
Copy
Edit
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
Build and run the project:

After ensuring all dependencies are in place, build the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo build
Then run the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo run
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

Running Migrations:

Run the database migrations to set up the schema:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo run --release
This will apply any new database changes and create the necessary tables.

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

Depth History: /api/depth

Earnings History: /api/earnings

Swap History: /api/swap

Runepool Units History: /api/runepool

These routes are handled in the src/api/routes folder, and each corresponds to a specific database model for handling the respective data.

Cron Jobs
This project includes cron jobs that periodically fetch and update cryptocurrency data. The jobs are located in the src/services/jobs/cron/ directory. You can run the cron jobs by executing the cargo run command.
